### About project

This project is the final project of Udacity React Nanodegree. It
was a little project to pass course but i wanted to practice unit test
with redux using jest.
These test are simple of code that execute same functions than redux
and expect to get same result that should generate in the use
of the app.

### About me

Im a junior developer on frontend and backend that like to learn all
about technologies. I liked to learn react native so much because i
think is amazing to develop a simple app to do anything without learn
java for android or swift for iOs.

React native give me a tool to develop in mobile platform, i only need
a good idea and develop it!
